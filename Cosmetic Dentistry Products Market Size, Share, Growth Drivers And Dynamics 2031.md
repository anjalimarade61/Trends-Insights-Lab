The demand for aesthetic dental procedures, particularly teeth whitening, veneers, and dental implants, is driving the market's expansion. Increasing awareness about oral health and the rising trend of self-care, fueled by social media influences, are major factors contributing to this growth. Additionally, technological advancements in dental materials and procedures, such as the introduction of laser dentistry and 3D printing, have further stimulated demand across both emerging and developed markets.</p><p>The market's growth is also supported by the growing geriatric population, which is more susceptible to dental problems, as well as the rise in disposable incomes allowing individuals to invest in cosmetic procedures. As more people seek smile enhancement treatments, there is a growing preference for non-invasive methods, such as teeth whitening and bonding, which also boosts market dynamics.
